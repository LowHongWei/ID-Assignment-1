So, my project is a retail website. I specialise in clothes and the website is for to sell clothes to other people online. I have the inventory of the clothes and this website is just a place to put up the website. It has articles on the newest shoes so people can see what the hype is about. There is promotions which will attract buyers(The cost has been reduced in the total as well). There are different categories of clothes for different genders and they can also buy from any genre they like and add it to the cart. The cart can store items from both genders and any category. They will be able to see what is in the cart and remove it if they wish. There is also a checkout page where there is validations for them to put in their card numbers. This is the website to go as the design is clean but interactive and we have a wide genre of clothing. It caters to mainly adults as we have not added a kids section yet. So, I designed this website for everyday online shoppers. I wanted to add features that I think are helpful and easy to navigate. Personally, when I want to go online shopping I want to spend most of my time shopping and not finding how to get there. Therefore, I added easy to navigate words that have links to where its suppose to bring them. There are also links that go back to the previous page so if they get bored they are able to browse more without having to go through the trouble of clicking button randomly until they are able to find their way back. There are a few main features that I feel make my website stand out, those are, the slider, cart interface, the hover effects, and checkout page. Firstly, the slider allows scroll through articles with a click of a button, and when you click on the slides. It will bring you to the website that those articles are from, so you can read the whole article. The second feature is the most complicated yet coolest. I have add to cart button at the bottom of my products. When I click on them it add it to the cart. When you click the Cart Icon it shows you all the items that you have clicked. Yet, it does not show the duplicates of the items. If you want to add more you are able to change the quantities of the items which is located at the side of the product price. If you dont want the item anymore you can remove it with the remove button and the whole item will disappear from the cart. While all of this is happening there is the total price at the bottom which is constantly updating. So if you add an item it will add that items price. If you add more quantity of that item it will add that amount times the quantity. If you remove the item it will deduct the price from the total. This is all being done through java script. I am able to get the items from many pages because I add them to an array and store it in the localstorage which cannnot be reset even if the page is refreshed. Once the customer is satisfied and presses the button to pay there is a command in java script which clears the local storage and redirects you to the checkout page. Which is the next feature I think is cool. Like any other checkout page, it requires a card number and your details. So, I put the command required for every text box. So when you try to pay without filling in any of the details it will alert you and not proceed with the transaction. For the hover effects, when you hover over the navigation bar it will turn red and when you click on any of the buttons it will light up green. I made it because we are currently in the holiday season and I wanted to do something seasonal. For the Categories when you hover over the image it will tell you what categories that is. I made all of this with the :hover command. All the things I used are, HTML for the skeleton of the website, JS to do cool features, CSS to beautify the website, JSON to put the items into a string and change it out for my array for my shopping cart. The only problem I faced was linking a submit button to another website, which is the Checkout button to the MessagePage website.
